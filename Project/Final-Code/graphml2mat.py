"""
Converts graphml format graphs to mat format.
This utility can be applied to graphs of /any/ size in graphml format that you
wish to transform to a mat file format. Note that this currently does not 
preserve edge or node atrributes, and assumes an undirected but weighted graph.
 You have the option to delete isolates or leave them untouched, as well.
  Inputs
      graph: a graphml formatted graph (equivalent to those produced from the 
      igraph library)
			prune (optional): argument to delete zero degree nodes
  Returns
      graph: a mat formatted graph in the form of an NxN adjacency matrix, 
      where N is the number of nodes in the original graph.
